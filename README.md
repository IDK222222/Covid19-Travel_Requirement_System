# Covid19-Travel_Requirement_System

The Travel Ranking System is a Java program that allows users to input their information, including their full name, last name, country of origin, and the date of departure. The program then determines the ranking of the user's country of origin and provides them with the option to choose a location to visit. Based on the combined ranking of the country and the chosen location, the program outputs an overall danger rank that determines whether the user is allowed to travel or not.
